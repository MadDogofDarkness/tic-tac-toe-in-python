# tic-tac-toe-in-python
this is a basic tic tac toe game in python
include the smile.bmp file, its the icon for the game
and i havn't yet implemented the script to create its own icon if it cant find this one yet
there's some code commented out from debug stuff, so ignore that ill clean it up if i feel like it later
anyway have fun!
let me know if it bugs or whatever, thanks!
